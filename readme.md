## Decrisciption 

Tests provide much more than simple regression. The test scenarios tell a story of what your code does and how it's used. Unfortunately, most unit tests obscure this in setup, mocks, and cryptic asserts. We're going to look at a few stories of taking unit tests and making them more expressive, so you can get a better sense of the story they are trying to tell, while at the same time making them easier to write.
